# Slo_Hacks_2022-The_Feels

This is the final project of the work fone for "The Feels" app for the 2022 SLO Hacks. 
This app was developed by Anais Gomez, Hailey Choi, and Kevin Tan. 
This app is designed to help children learn more about their emotions and learn how to have more control and a better grasp on thier emotions. 

The following code is a very rough display of how our app is supposed to work. 
As of now (4/10/2022), most of the code is not commented and the programs still sometimes crashes. This is due to time constraints on getting 
a working prototype to show off our intended features and mapping of our app. 
If ther are any questions don't hesitate to reach out to ktan30@calpoly.edu, where I will try to answer as many of your questions
as possible.
